## Due Tuesday, June 5:
### Critique
* Read: [Interest Driven Music Education](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-48yT32wSb3rI_AuayWQ2FhmWdO8C1Kv). (Yes, games like RockBand and the instruments you made can have awesome benefits!)

### Create
In your ***Design Journal***, create a reflection on the Cloud Valley trip with the following slides.
* **Slide 1:** Describe what you and your team made. What are the inputs, e.g. how is it controlled? What are the outputs, e.g. what sounds/visuals does it produce?
* **Slide 2:** How did seventh graders interact with your instrument? What worked? What would you change? What was unexpected?
* **Slide 3:** How did first graders interact with your instrument? What worked? What would you change? What was unexpected?
* **Slide 4:** Summarize your individual interview with a Cloud Valley student.

### Teams
* Shanghai Symphony:
  * Familiarize yourself with the education offerings from the [New York Philharmonic](https://nyphil.org), [Carnegie Hall](https://www.carnegiehall.org), and [Lincoln Center for the Arts](http://www.lincolncenter.org). Consider which age groups the education materials appear to be targeting.
