## Due Tuesday, June 5:
### Critique
* Read: [Interest Driven Music Education](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-48yT32wSb3rI_AuayWQ2FhmWdO8C1Kv). (Yes, games like RockBand and the instruments you made can have awesome benefits!)

### Create
In your ***Design Journal***, create a reflection on the Cloud Valley trip with the following slides.
* **Slide 1:** Describe what you and your team made. What are the inputs, e.g. how is it controlled? What are the outputs, e.g. what sounds/visuals does it produce?
* **Slide 2:** How did seventh graders interact with your instrument? What worked? What would you change? What was unexpected?
* **Slide 3:** How did first graders interact with your instrument? What worked? What would you change? What was unexpected?
* **Slide 4:** Summarize your individual interview with a Cloud Valley student.

### Teams
* Shanghai Symphony:
  * Familiarize yourself with the education offerings from the [New York Philharmonic](https://nyphil.org), [Carnegie Hall](https://www.carnegiehall.org), and [Lincoln Center for the Arts](http://www.lincolncenter.org). Consider which age groups the education materials appear to be targeting.
  * Added Sunday: [If you have Instagram, please check out this resource as well.](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17873612905242611/?hl=en)
* Tinkamo: Watch the videos and read the descriptions on [Tinkamo's Kickstarter page](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/44540085/tinkamo-smart-building-blocks-for-future-creators).

## Due Thursday, June 7:
### Critique
* Read: [Lean UX, Preface, Chapters 1–2](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HCQwuqg8Fr0qRZcNzMxyq0U6YRByz9uZ)
  * Overview of the rapid method of design we are about to embark on.
  * pp. 15–34 in the pdf. Ignore the "Notes" at the end of the preface.
* Read: [Lifelong Kindergarten, Chapter 6](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WhPfNpvASjJc5bRjbXEql1u_NCucV1xI)
  * Resnick's vision of a creative society as well as his many design tips should prove valuable for all our projects.
* Watch: [Edith Ackerman on Curiosity and Learning](https://vimeo.com/144683857) (below)

### Create
#### Cloud Valley
In your ***Design Journal***, flesh out one of the personas we created today in class. You may choose either a first or seventh grader. Beyond needs and motivations, you should include a profile picture (real or cartoon, found online is fine) and fictional bio rooted in the stories of the students you met. [The Christie example near the end of the IDF page on personas](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/personas-why-and-how-you-should-use-them) is a useful reference though yours does not have to be as long. Finally, come up with an idea for an activity for that student. In bullet points or fewer than three sentences, what is the attraction, engagement, and conclusion?

#### SSO
Continue to review educational offerings of orchestras around the world.

#### Tinkamo
Find an experience created with a Scratch extension. Tinker with it and report back in one or more slides in your ***Design Journal***. How does the example work? What do the new extension blocks afford? Do they make sense or are they confusing? What would you add to or change about the extension? Be prepared to show off your example+extension on Thursday.

You might want to check out the following extensions:
* [ScratchX + Spotify](https://ericrosenbaum.github.io/spotify-extension/)
* [Performamatics](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/222541/) (music modules built in Scratch)
* [Cognimates AI Library](https://mitmedialab.github.io/cognimates-website/projects/).
  * [Try extensions here](https://codelab.cognimates.me) by clicking in the bottom left corner to add.
* [Lego WeDo](https://scratch.mit.edu/wedo)
* (You are welcome to select another ScratchX project on the [extensions page](https://scratchx.org/#extensions), but not all work.)
