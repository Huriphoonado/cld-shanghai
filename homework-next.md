This page is for Alex, Willie, and Lulu to plan upcoming assignments...

### Due Thursday, May 31:
#### Curate
Take a picture of an object in the world with affordances. (These are discussed beginning on p. 10 in [*The Design of Everyday Things*](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RUOBMvSxUY9QhSlO4MmMfIESz_LbzKaH).) Then, include the picture in your ***Design Journal*** alongside a list of the object's affordances. Does the object have any signifiers or mappings? What are they and how well do they work?

#### Create
Finalize your MaKey+Scratch instrument with your team! Remember to plan how you will present it to first graders vs. seventh graders and how to involve each age group.

We are visiting Cloud Valley School for the entire day. Please **meet in the lobby at NYU no later than 7:00am** for the bus to take us all there. The schedule for the visit will be posted soon and linked here.

#### Create
Create a short presentation summarizing your interactions with students at Cloud Valley. Your presentation must include at least four slides.
* **Slide 1:** Give the class a quick recap on what you built.
* **Slide 2:** How did seventh graders interact with your instrument? What worked? What didn't work? What was unexpected?
* **Slide 3:** How did first graders interact with your instrument? What worked? What didn't work? What was unexpected?
* **Slide 4:** What would you change about your instrument. Remember, this course is entitled "Creative Learning Design." How would you improve your instrument's user experience, effectiveness in encouraging creativity, and/or use as a teaching tool?

You will have five minutes to present to the class and five minutes for class feedback/discussion. Please include your slides in the [Presentations folder under today's date.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KzTO5KJZ45cFLpBXPX_LRzi0o0mutwdm)
