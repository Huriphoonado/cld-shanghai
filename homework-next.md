Fill out the right side.

Further review

#### Tinkamo
Find an experience created with a Scratch extension. Tinker with it and report back in one or more slides in your ***Design Journal***. How does the example work? What do the new extension blocks afford? Do they make sense or are they confusing? What would you add to or change about the extension? Be prepared to show off your extension on Thursday.

You might want to check out the following extensions:
* [ScratchX + Spotify](https://ericrosenbaum.github.io/spotify-extension/)
* [Performamatics](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/222541/) (music modules built in Scratch)
* [Cognimates AI Library](http://mitmedialab.github.io/cognimates-website/). [Try extensions here](https://codelab.cognimates.me) by clicking in the bottom left corner to add.
* [Lego WeDo](https://scratch.mit.edu/wedo)
* (You are welcome to select another ScratchX project on the [extensions page](https://scratchx.org/#extensions), but not all work.)
