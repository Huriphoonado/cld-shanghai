This page is for Alex, Willie, and Lulu to plan upcoming assignments...

### Due Thursday, May 31:
#### Curate
Take a picture of an object in the world with affordances. (These are discussed beginning on p. 10 in [*The Design of Everyday Things*](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RUOBMvSxUY9QhSlO4MmMfIESz_LbzKaH).) Then, include the picture in your ***Design Journal*** alongside a list of the object's affordances. Does the object have any signifiers or mappings? What are they and how well do they work?

#### Create
Finalize your MaKey+Scratch instrument with your team! Remember to plan how you will present it to first graders vs. seventh graders and how to involve each age group. Also, write down your questions for an individual student on the handout we provide you with in class.

We are visiting Cloud Valley School for the entire day.
* Please **meet in the lobby at NYU at 6:50am** for the bus to take us all there.
* Bring writing materials, the handouts provided in class today, and make sure someone in your team is bringing a computer to run your project.
* Please bring water and breakfast. Lunch and dinner will be provided.
* [The schedule for the visit can be found in the course drive.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1YtA3c1THqW6fBna2fNxYLi4ygty1Uv28)

### Due Next Tuesday, June 5:
#### Critique
* Read: [Interest Driven Music Education](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-48yT32wSb3rI_AuayWQ2FhmWdO8C1Kv). (Yes, games like RockBand and the instruments you made can have awesome benefits!)

#### Create
In your ***Design Journal***, create a reflection on the Cloud Valley trip with the following slides.
* **Slide 1:** Describe what you and your team made. What are the inputs, e.g. how is it controlled? What are the outputs, e.g. what sounds/visuals does it produce?
* **Slide 2:** How did seventh graders interact with your instrument? What worked? What didn't work? What was unexpected?
* **Slide 3:** How did first graders interact with your instrument? What worked? What didn't work? What was unexpected?
* **Slide 4:** If you were to continue working on your instrument, what would you change about it? Remember, this course is entitled "Creative Learning Design." How would you improve your instrument's user experience, effectiveness in encouraging creativity, and/or use as a teaching tool?
* **Slide 5:** Summarize your individual interview with a Cloud Valley student.

#### Teams
* Cloud Valley: TBD
* Shanghai Symphony: Familiarize your the education offerings from the [New York Philharmonic](https://nyphil.org), [Carnegie Hall](https://www.carnegiehall.org), and [Lincoln Center for the Arts](http://www.lincolncenter.org). Consider which age groups the education materials appear to be targeting.
* Tinkamo: Watch the videos and read the descriptions on [Tinkamo's Kickstarter page](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/44540085/tinkamo-smart-building-blocks-for-future-creators).
