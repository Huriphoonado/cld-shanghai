# Creative Learning Design
Home page for the Creative Learning Design Course at NYU Shanghai taught in Summer, 2018.

The easiest way to view the page is to find it live at http://creativelearningchina.org.

Otherwise, you can build and view it on your local machine following the instructions below:
1. [Install Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)
2. Copy this directory to your local machine and navigate to it in your terminal
3. Run the command `bundle exec jekyll serve`
4. Navigate to the url it prints, likely http://127.0.0.1:4000
